\section{Motivation}
Automatic Speech Recognition is a very important and popular technology in Human Computer Interactions. In recent years, device and software that support ASR system are increasing rapidly. Diversification of interacting with a system is increasing. People are not satisfied with just interacting with a computer through mouth and keyboards. Automatic Speech Recognition is a very good technology for HCI as human-human communication are mostly through speech. Audiovisual automatic speech recognition has shown significant improvement by including visual information. In human-human communication, people are able to understand others by reading the signal of facial expression, some non-linguistic vocalization, gestures. \cite{petridis2011prediction} Laughter are commonly used in human social conversation. However, the research in recognising the non-linguistic vocalization is rare. Moreover, people usually not just talking during conversation, they could also be smiling or eating while interaction with other people. This project is intend to try to automatically distinguish video sequence of some different facial expressions, such as normal face, eating and talking.
\section{Thesis}
This project is trying to detect eating, talking and normal state of face from videos that are recorded using webcam. The process of project includes two main steps, first step is to extract suitable features that could accurately represent facial expression of each frame. Second step is to experiment o
