\section{Motivation}
Automatic Speech Recognition is a very important and popular technology in Human Computer Interactions. In recent years, device and software that support ASR system are increasing rapidly. Diversification of interacting with a system is increasing. People are not satisfied with just interacting with a computer through mouth and keyboards. Automatic Speech Recognition is a very good technology for HCI as human-human communication are mostly through speech. However, human also can understand others by reading the signal of facial expression, some non-linguistic vocalization, even small gesture.\cite{petridis2011prediction} Laughter are commonly used in human social conversation. However, the research in recognising the non-linguistic vocalization is rare.
