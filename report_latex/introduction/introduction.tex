\section{Motivation}
Automatic Speech Recognition is a very important and popular technology in Human Computer Interactions. In recent years, device and software that support ASR system are increasing rapidly. Diversification of interacting with a system is increasing. People are not satisfied with just interacting with a computer through mouth and keyboards. Automatic Speech Recognition is a very good technology for HCI as human-human communication are mostly through speech. Audiovisual automatic speech recognition has shown significant improvement by including visual information. In human-human communication, people are able to understand others by reading the signal of facial expression, some non-linguistic vocalization, gestures. \cite{petridis2011prediction} Laughter are commonly used in human social conversation. However, the research in recognising the non-linguistic vocalization is rare. This project is intend to try to automatically distinguish video sequence of some different facial expressions, normal face, eating and talking.
